  "about": "I'm a problem solver and tech enthusiast. The goal is to make things easier for everyone, no matter what it takes. I'm currently working at HP Inc. as a Third Level Support Engineer, where I'm the last stop for support working on sophisticated problems. When I'm not pouring over newly raised tickets, I like to bake bread, paint, and play tabletop RPG's."
