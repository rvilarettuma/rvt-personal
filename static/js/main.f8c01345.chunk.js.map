A vestige of the early 2000's; The\n          dedicated room for a beige Compaq and it's shrieking counterpart: the\n          modem. The nightly ritual of tolerating dial-up screeching and\n          launching up RuneScape was enough to enthrall me. It was also enough\n          for my immigrant parents to brand me as the resident computer expert,\n          a role I accepted with great reverance.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I was fortunate enough to come across a group of friends who also\n          shared my enjoyment of computer games. Through them, and with some\n          help from my grandfather, I hand selected components and built my\n          first gaming PC. This was quite the endeavor, but the experience\n          granted me invaluable hardware knowledge and troubleshooting skills.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          By high school, I had managed to establish quite the technological\n          foundation for myself. I joined the school's PC Support group, where I\n          actively served as a technician for the school's 4000 students and\n          accompanying faculty. I partook in an exclusive software engineering\n          mentorship program with the Miami-Dade County IT Department. I earned\n          several Microsoft and Adobe certifications. I even managed to win\n          Miami-Dade County Public Schools Hour of Code competion, where my\n          entry was selected (in the winning Top 20) from a pool of 530\n          contenders.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Presently, I am employed at Colorado State University as a Student IT\n          Administrator. Since I have completed my Bachelor of Science in\n          Applied Computing Technology, I am currently looking for work across a\n          variety of fields. System Administration, DevOps, and Web/Software\n          Development are all fields I've dabbled in, and would love to purse in\n          the future.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Bio;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Card from \"@material-ui/core/Card\";\nimport CardActions from \"@material-ui/core/CardActions\";\nimport CardContent from \"@material-ui/core/CardContent\";\nimport Code from \"@material-ui/icons/Code\";\nimport Link from \"@material-ui/icons/Link\";\nimport Button from \"@material-ui/core/Button\";\n\nfunction Projects() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"subheader\">\n        <h3>projects</h3>\n        <hr />\n      </div>\n      <Card>\n        <CardContent>\n          <h4>Tabularium</h4>\n          <h5>ReactJS</h5>\n          <p>\n            A random generator based on themed tables for tabletop gamers,\n            authors, and artists.\n          </p>\n        </CardContent>\n        <CardActions>\n          <Button startIcon={<Link />}href=\"https://ttt.rvtuma.com\">Website</Button>\n          <Button startIcon={<Code />}href=\"https://github.com/rvilarettuma/table-of-tables\">Github</Button>\n        </CardActions>\n      </Card>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Projects;\n","import \"./App.css\";\nimport { Container } from \"@material-ui/core\";\nimport Bio from \"./Application/Bio\";\nimport Projects from \"./Application/Projects\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Container maxWidth=\"lg\">\n        <header className=\"App-header\">\n          <h1>Richard Vilaret-Tuma</h1>\n          <h2>SysAdmin, Developer, DevOps</h2>\n        </header>\n        <Bio />\n        <Projects />\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/futura-bold.da745099.ttf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/futura-medium.16cf191d.woff\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Futura-Book-BT.683a5018.woff\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\";\nimport \"./fonts/futura-bold.ttf\";\nimport \"./fonts/futura-medium.woff\";\nimport \"./fonts/Futura-Book-BT.woff\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
