A vestige of the early 2000's; The\n              dedicated room for a beige Compaq and it's shrieking counterpart:\n              the modem. The nightly ritual of tolerating dial-up screeching and\n              launching up RuneScape was enough to enthrall me. It was also\n              enough for my immigrant parents to brand me as the resident\n              computer expert, a role I accepted with great reverance.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I was fortunate enough to come across a group of friends who also\n              shared my enjoyment of computer games. Through them, and with some\n              help from my grandfather, I hand selected components and built my\n              first gaming PC. This was quite the endeavor, but the experience\n              granted me invaluable hardware knowledge and troubleshooting\n              skills.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              By high school, I had managed to establish quite the technological\n              foundation for myself. I joined the school's PC Support group,\n              where I actively served as a technician for the school's 4000\n              students and accompanying faculty. I partook in an exclusive\n              software engineering mentorship program with the Miami-Dade County\n              IT Department. I earned several Microsoft and Adobe\n              certifications. I even managed to win Miami-Dade County Public\n              Schools Hour of Code competion, where my entry was selected (in\n              the winning Top 20) from a pool of 530 contenders.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Presently, I am employed at Colorado State University as a Student\n              IT Administrator. Since I have completed my Bachelor of Science in\n              Applied Computing Technology, I am currently looking for work\n              across a variety of fields. System Administration, DevOps, and\n              Web/Software Development are all fields I've dabbled in, and would\n              love to purse in the future.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <h4>PROJECTS</h4>\n        </body>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/futura-bold.da745099.ttf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/futura-medium.16cf191d.woff\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Futura-Book-BT.683a5018.woff\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\";\nimport \"./fonts/futura-bold.ttf\";\nimport \"./fonts/futura-medium.woff\";\nimport \"./fonts/Futura-Book-BT.woff\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
